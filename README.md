# Computational Statistics Final Project 
# Open Policing Project
## Searching for police bias in traffic arrest trends across major U.S cities

Why this is exciting: <br />
The Stanford Open Policing Project has investigated traffic arrest trends and searched for possible signs of racial discrimination in the data presented. We want to use their data-set to investigate similar ideas using different variables and threshold test percentages. We want to know how the statistics they used influenced the outcomes they got in order to understand police interactions in a more layered way.


Data and Variables: <br />
The data set we will use is available at https://openpolicing.stanford.edu is csv and rds formats. The data is organized by location and all the variables are not available for each location. We will look at detailed data for major cities like San Francisco and New York.
In the provided datasets, the variables for each pull-over incident are date, time, race of the driver, age and sex. Other than these basic variables, we will be examining 'reason for stop', 'search conducted' and 'arrest made' variables.

End Product: <br />
For our final product we will be creating a Shiny application that contains a map of arrest rates by race and visualizations of different threshold test statistics.
